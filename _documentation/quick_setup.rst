A Quick Tutorial
****************

Ok, if you're impatient this is the short, short version of getting setup with blogofile.

* Install Blogofile, (see :ref:`install-blogofile`):

 ``sudo easy_install blogofile``

* In a clean directory, initialize the bare bones sample site:

 ``blogofile init``

* Or, for a bit more complete sample blog:

 ``git clone git://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile.com.git``

* Create some post files in the _posts directory. (see :ref:`posts`)

* Build the site:

 ``blogofile build``

* Serve the site:

 ``blogofile serve 8080``

* open your web browser to `http://localhost:8080 <http://localhost:8080>`_ to see the built site.

The next chapters explain this process in more detail.
