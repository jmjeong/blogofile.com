Welcome to Blogofile
====================

Blogofile is a simple blog engine that requires no database and no special hosting environment. You customize a set of templates with `Mako <http://www.maktotemplates.org>`_, create posts in a markup language of your choice (see :ref:`post-content`) and Blogofile renders your entire blog as static HTML and Atom/RSS feeds which you can then upload to any old web server you like. 

**No CGI or scripting environment is needed on the server.**

Why you should be using Blogofile
=================================
* Blogofile is **free software**, released under a non-enforced `MIT License`_.
* Blogofile is **fast**, the server doesn't need to do any database lookups nor any template rendering.
* Blogofile is **inexpensive** to host. Any web server can host a blogofile blog.
* Blogofile is **modern**, supporting all the common blogging features:

 * Categories.
 * Tags.
 * Comments and Trackbacks with effective spam filtering using `Disqus <http://www.disqus.com>`_. (Sorry no pingback support.. yet.)
 * RSS and Atom feeds, one for all your posts, as well as one per category.
 * Syntax highlighting for source code listings.

* Blogofile is **secure**, there's nothing executable on the server.
* Blogofile works **offline**, with a built-in webserver you can work on your site from anywhere.
* Blogofile is **file based**, so you can edit it with your favorite text editor, not some crappy web interface.
* Seamless :ref:`Git Integration <vcs-integration>`. Publish to your blog with a simple ``git push``. This also makes **backups** dirt simple.
